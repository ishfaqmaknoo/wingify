Q2:- function block is used to wrap the set of logic,or we can say a modular way of writing code  which will not make any conflict to other functionalities, and it's best practice to make our code clean and reusable


Q3:-
a:- console.log(0.1 + 0.2);

---> 0.30000000000000004

b:- console.log(0.1+0.2 == 0.3)
---> False

Note:--  0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004, which means 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3, 

Q4:- 
a:-
function sum(x, y) {
	return x + y;
}

console.log(sum(2, 3)); 

//result ------> 5

b:-

function sum(a) {
	let firstEl = a;

	function next(b) {
		firstEl += b;
	}
	next.toString = function() {
		return firstEl;
	};

	return next;
}

console.log(sum(2)(3));

Q5:-

var length = 10;

function fn() {
	console.log(this.length);
	//10
}

var obj = {
	length: 5,

	method: function(fn) {
		fn();
		//10

		arguments[0]();
	}
};

obj.method(fn, 1);

answer, 10 and undefined
